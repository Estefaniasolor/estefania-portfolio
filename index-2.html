        <ul>
            
            <h3>Dance Diaries (2021)</h3>
        
        <p><i>Dance Diaries</i> is a deeply introspective and movement-driven exploration of personal and collective experiences. This piece reflects on the body's ability to archive memory, tracing the physical and emotional imprints left by time, encounters, and transitions. Through a fusion of contemporary and traditional movement practices, <i>Dance Diaries</i> unfolds as a series of embodied narratives—each gesture carrying a fragment of history, identity, and transformation.</p>
        <p>The performance navigates themes of displacement, adaptation, and resilience, drawing from personal experiences and ethnographic observation. It invites audiences to witness the subtle interplay between internal and external landscapes, where movement becomes both a form of storytelling and a means of reclaiming agency over one’s own history.</p>

        <h3>El Abrazo (2020)</h3>
        <p><i>El Abrazo</i> is the inaugural performance of the movement research project <i>Forgetting Flowers</i>. This work is a deeply personal exploration of heritage, memory, and renewal, weaving together ancestral narratives with contemporary movement practices. It draws from a vivid childhood memory: my first encounter with an indigenous man. This recollection becomes a symbolic representation of ancestral history, as seen through the eyes of the young girl I once was.</p>

            <h3>Checked. Not Checked. (2018) (Co-choreographed with Shyrine Ziadeh)</h3>
        <p>This piece takes the Qalandia checkpoint as a starting point to explore the psychological and physical experience of being in a state of transition. It captures the sense of entrapment—unable to move forward or backward—both physically and mentally. The performance asks: What happens when we wait? How do we navigate feelings of confusion, anxiety, and uncertainty?
        </p>
        <p>Drawing from documentary narratives, the work incorporates the voice of a woman speaking about Qalandia checkpoint and a man recounting his experiences in both Palestinian and Israeli prisons, highlighting the psychological toll of waiting, surveillance, and uncertainty.</p>
            <li><strong>In Touch (2017)</strong><br>
        <p><i>In Touch</i> is about the connections everyone has in life with the people they love, work with, or even encounter on the street. These connections can be emotional, subconscious, visual, or physical; they can exist in the present moment or across distance and time. Being in touch, staying in touch, and getting in touch often involve overcoming fear, which is a common experience for foreigners in unfamiliar surroundings.</p>
        <p>This piece reflects the emotions of living far away from loved ones, illustrating how we remain connected through invisible threads of time and space. The work aligns with my research, exploring physical motivation through reactions and feelings, using real physical experiences drawn from memory—whether positive or negative. It serves as a moment of catharsis through the language of dance.</p>
